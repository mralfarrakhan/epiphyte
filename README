========

Dll injector and inter-process call client via REST based on dll-syringe and axum.

Usage
-----

This utility read configuration file to define target, payload, REST port, and paths.

Configuration path can be set with -c/--config-path, otherwise it will lookup for config.toml at working directory.

CLI arguments override configuration values. Run with flag -h/--help for more information.

This utility expose RPC call to injected dll to REST API:
- /info: returns info of current process base name, executable path, and pid.
- /execute/{PATH}: trigger functions on injected payload via name (see configuration).

x86 payloads only work for x86 targets, and vice versa for x86_64.

Configuration
-------------

```toml
target_name = "winzip-x86.exe" # name of the target process
payload_path = "./payload-x86.dll" # path to payload binary
port = 80800 # port for REST server (default: 8070)

[[paths]]
name = "offset" # simple path where exported name is set as REST path

[[paths]]
name = "execute"
symbol = "_ZN6viewer9Decryptor7executeEv" # symbol can be set explicitly, usable if target function name is mangled
```

If multiple paths is set to a same symbol, only one would be keep.

Run with flag -v/--verbose to show corresponding name, symbol, and its address.

To do
-----

- Allow return value retrieval.
- Allow parameter passing.
