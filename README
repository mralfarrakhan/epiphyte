Dll injector and inter-process call client via REST based on dll-syringe and axum.

Usage
-----

This utility read configuration file to define target, payload, REST port, and paths. Configuration path can be set with -c/--config-path, otherwise it will look for config.toml in the working directory.

CLI arguments override configuration values. Run with flag -h/--help to show available overrides.

This utility exposes RPC call for injected dll to a REST API interface:
- GET /info: returns info of current process base name, executable path, and pid.
- GET /execute/{PATH}: trigger functions on injected payload via name (see configuration).

x86 payloads only work for x86 targets, and vice versa for x86_64.

Configuration
-------------

```toml
# name of the target process
target_name = "winzip-x86.exe"

# path to payload binary
payload_path = "./payload-x86.dll"

# port for REST server (default: 8070)
port = 80800 

# simple path where symbol name can be set as path
[[paths]]
name = "offset" 

# symbol can be set explicitly, usable if the function name is mangled
[[paths]]
name = "execute"
symbol = "_ZN6viewer9Decryptor7executeEv"
```

If multiple paths are set to a same symbol name, only one would be kept. Run with flag -v/--verbose to show corresponding name, symbol, and its address. Some note:
- UNACCESSIBLE path is symbol found on the payload but not in config.
- If path is defined in config but the symbol is not found in the payload, it wouldn't be listed.

To do
-----

- Allow return value retrieval.
- Allow parameter passing.
